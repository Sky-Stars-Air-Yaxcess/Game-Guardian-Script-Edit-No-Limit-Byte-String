I haven't stolen any code or script from anyone. That's not true. It's possible that what they're doing is a coincidenceâ€”the search and editing of a string in Game Guardianâ€”if you have seen that somewhere else.


For the clowns.
â€‹I have never stolen anything from anyone. If you see something similar, it means either someone actually stole from me, or it is a coincidence that it looks alike. It's also possible that we use the same work logic and code, which does not mean I have stolen anything.
